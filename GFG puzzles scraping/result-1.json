        "question": "In a Medical Laboratory, you have 240 Injections, one of which is for Anesthesia for a rat. If Anesthesia injection is injected in a rat, it will faint in exactly 24 hours. You have 5 rats available to determine which one injection contains the Anesthesia. How do you achieve this in 48 hours ? ",
        "answer": "Solution: Let us number the each injection with unique 5 digit numbers consisting of only 0, 1 and 2. Let us number the Rats as 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000. The action corresponding to the digit in the unit place will be executed by rat numbered 1. The action corresponding to the digit in the tenth place will be executed by rat numbered 10. The action corresponding to the digit in the 100th place will be executed by rat numbered 100. The action corresponding to the digit in the 1000th place will be executed by rat numbered 1000. The action corresponding to the digit in the 10000th place will be executed by rat numbered 10000. Number 0 on an Injection represents that the injection will not be injected to rat. \nNumber 1 on an Injection represents that the injection will be injected to rat on 1st day. \nNumber 2 on an Injection represents that the injection will be injected to rat on 2nd day (after 24 hours). Example: Let us say the Injection is numbered 11201. The Injections is injected on the first day to rat numbered 10000, 1000 and 1. It is injected on the second day to rat numbered 100. And it is not injected to rat numbered 10. So if the rats numbered 10000, 1000 and 1 faint within first 24 hours, rat numbered 100 faints in the next 24 hours and the rat numbered 10 does not faint, then the Anesthesia Injection has to be 11201. Total number of injections that can be tested in this way will be:3*3*3*3*3 = 243. So, with the help of 5 rats and within 48 hours we will be able to find a Anesthesia Injection among 240 Injections. Additional Note from Bot creators: The 3 cases where the injection number will be 11111, 00000 or 22222 are ignored as they can be deduced easily without using injections. The language of this puzzle has also been changed: rats from slaves, Anesthesia injection from poison, faint from death, etc. \nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-5-finding-the-poisoned-wine/"

        "answer": "Solution: The idea of filling coins in the powers of 2 can be get from the condition that was given the question that each bag can be given or not given, that is we are not allowed to open the bag and give some coins. So we can represent each bag as each place value which takes either the value of 0 or 1. For example if we have to give 7 coins then it is nothing but 0000000111 the last 3 digits of 1 represents that those 3 bags whose place values are 1,2,4 are to be given to give 7 coins. Remember that each bag should be either given or not given that means there are only 2 choices to us, which has similarity with the numbers in base 2 where each digit has only 2 values either 1 or 0.\nWe can fill coins in the 10 bags in increasing order of 2^n where n varies from 0-8, filling the last bag with all remaining coins as follows: 1 = 2^0 = 1 2 = 2^1 = 2 3 = 2^2 = 4 4 = 2^3 = 8 5 = 2^4 = 16 6 = 2^5 = 32 7 = 2^6 = 64 8 = 2^7 = 128 9 = 2^8 = 256 10 = remaining coins = 489 Now, the dealer can make any number of coins just by handing over the bags. As, \nnumber 0f coins needed = some bag 1 + some bag 2 + .... + some bag n \nexample: \n519 coins = bag 2 + bag 4 + bag 8 + bag 16 + bag 489. \nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-11-1000-coins-and-10-bags/"

        "answer": "Solution: First, let us assume that we divided the balls into jars equally so each jar will contain 50 balls.\nSo the probability of selecting a white ball will be=probability of selecting the first jar*probability of white ball in the first jar + probability of selecting the second jar*probability of white ball in the second jar\n=(1/2)*(0/50)+(1/2)*(50/50)=0.5\nSince we have to maximize the probability so we will increase the probability of white ball in the first jar and keep the second probability same mean equal to 1\nso we add 49 white balls with 50 black balls in the first jar and only one white ball in the second jar\nso the probability will be now= Therefore, probability of getting white ball becomes 1/2*1 + 1/2*49/99 which is approximately 3/4.

How many prisoners can be saved at most if they are allowed to discuss a strategy before the jailer starts asking colors of their hats. ",
        "answer": "Answer: \nAt-most 99 prisoners can be saved and the 100th prisoner has 50-50 chances of being executed. \nThe idea is that every prisoner counts number of red hats in front of him. 100th prisoner says red if the number of red hats is even.

There is a row of even number of coins, and a player on his/her turn can pick a coin from any of the two corners of the row. The player that collects coins with more value wins the game. Develop a strategy for the player making the first turn i.e, Player A, such that he/she never loses the game. Note that the strategy to pick a maximum of two corners may not work. ",
        "answer": "Solution:\nThe idea is to count the sum of values of all even coins and odd coins, compare the two values. The player that makes the first move can always make sure that the other player is never able to choose an even coin if the sum of even coins is higher. Similarly, he/she can make sure that the other player is never able to choose an odd coin if the sum of odd coins is higher. Example: Suppose you are given the following rows of coins: Coins at even places: 20, 30, 14\nCoins at odd places: 18, 15, 10\nThese places are fixed independent of whether the choice of selection must begin from the left or the right-hand side. Step 1: Sum of all even placed coins = 20 + 30 + 14 = 64\nStep 2: Sum of all odd placed coins = 18 + 15 + 10 = 43\nStep 3: Comparing the even and the odd placed coins where EVEN > ODD Therefore, Player A must start selecting from the right-hand side and choose all the even-placed coins every time(here they are 14, 30 and 20). So first picker, Player A picks 14. Now, irrespective of whether the second Player B starts selecting from the left-hand side i.e., 18 or from the right-hand side i.e., 20, the even placed coins i.e., 14, 30 and 20 are booked for the Player A. Therefore, be any situation arise, the first picker Player A will always win the game. \nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-14-strategy-for-a-2-player-coin-game/"

        "answer": "Answer: 08/31/1380.\nOne year can have only one palindrome as the year fixes the month and date too, so the year has to be less than 2001 since we already have the palindrome for 10/02. It can't be any year in 1900 because that would result in a day of 91, same for 1800 down to 1400. it could be a year in 1300 because that would be the 31st day. So what's the latest year in 1300 that would make a month?\nWhen you first look at it, 12th month comes to mind as we have to find the latest date, so it seems it would be 1321. But we have to keep in mind that we want the maximum year in 1300 century with a valid date, so lets think about 1390 that will give the date as 09/31, is this a valid date? No, because September has only 30 days, so last will be the 31st August. \nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-30-last-palindrome-data/"

        "answer": "Answer: 16. 100% of task = 18 days As he doubles the task everyday. So, 50% of task = 17 days 25% of task = 16 days. Alternative Solution : Let the amount of work the man did on first day be x and total work to be done be S. As the amount of work he did on next day would be 2 times of it's previous day, we can write amount of work he did on 2nd day as '2x', 3rd day '4x', 4th day '8x' and so on... We can write it as a GP as follows : S = x+2x+4x+8x+.... (till 18th day) S = x*(218-1)/(2-1). According to ques we have to find the day when he would complete 25% of the total work. We can write the expression as S/4 = x+2x+4x+8x+...  (till nth day) S/4=x*(2n-1)/(2-1) S/4=x*(2n-1) Substituting value of S from equation (1) x*(218-1)/4=x*(2n-1) On simplifying 218-1=4*(2n-1) 218-1=2n*4-4 2n+2=218+3    (2n*4=2n*22=2n+2) We can neglect 3 in comparison of 218 2n+2=218 n+2=18 n=16 days So answer is 16 days. \nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-32-completion-of-task/"

What strategy should be used to drop eggs such that total number of drops in worst case is minimized and we find the required floor. Creators message: This is a splendid example of Dynamic Programming and so do try this first on your own and then read the solution from the source",
        "answer": " If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be carried out in only one way. Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the worst case, this method may require 100 droppings.\nSuppose 2 eggs are available. What is the least number of egg-droppings that is guaranteed to work in all cases?\nThe problem is not actually to find the critical floor, but merely to decide floors from which eggs should be dropped so that total number of trials are minimized. If we use Binary Search Method to find the floor and we start from 50'th floor, then we end up doing 50 comparisons in worst case. The worst case happens when the required floor is 49'th floor. Optimized Method:\nThe idea is to do optimize the solution using below equation: The optimal number of trials is 14 in worst case.

There can be any number of white or black hats between 0 and 20. Each person can see the hat of all the persons ahead of him in the line, but not those of the people standing behind. Each person is required to guess (loudly) the color of his/her own hat. The objective is for the group to get as many correct guesses as possible. The group is allowed to discuss and form a strategy before the exercise. What is the best strategy? What is the maximum number of correct guesses in this strategy?",
        "answer": "Solution:\nThe person who stands last in the queue, behind everyone else, will count the number of white hats on the heads of the 19 people present ahead of him. If this number is even, he (loudly) guesses the hat on his head as \u2018Black'. if the number is odd, he guesses \u2018White'. The probability of the hat on his head being what he guessed is 50%. There is no way this person can guess the hat on his head correctly. However, his guess functions as a message to others in front of him. Suppose the 20th person guesses \u2018Black'. Now, the person who is 19th in the queue knows that the number of white hats on the first 19 people (the 18 people in front of him and himself) is even. He then checks whether the number of white hats in front of him is even or odd. If the number is even, that means the hat on his head is black. If the number is odd, that means the hat on his head is white and calls that out (loudly). Therefore, the 19th person in the queue always guesses correctly, based on the message the 20th person passed on. A similar strategy is followed by each person in turn. Therefore, everyone except the last (20th) person guesses correctly for sure. \nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-41-guess-color-of-hat/"

When the mother says that at least one of the two children has a muddy forehead, she is stating that the disjunction (s U d) is true.\nBoth children will answer \"No\" the first time the question is asked because each sees mud on the other child's forehead. That is, the son knows that d is true, but does not know whether s is true, and the daughter knows that s is true, but does not know whether d is true.\nAfter the son has answered \"No\" to the first question, the daughter can determine that d must be true. This follows because when the first question is asked, the son knows that (s U d) is true, but cannot determine whether s is true. Using this information, the daughter can conclude that d must be true, for if d were false, the son could have reasoned that because (s U d) is true, then s must be true, and he would have answered \"Yes\" to the first question. The son can reason in a similar way to determine that s must be true. It follows that both children answer \"Yes\" the second time the question is asked.

        "answer": "Solution: If you think the answer should be 1/2, you would be wrong. If you knew which child was a boy (say, the younger one), you would be closer to the truth.But since the boy could be either the younger or the older child, the analysis is more subtle. The answer would be 13/27. There can be four cases, i.e. either his brother has two boys, or one boy(elder) and one girl, one girl(elder) and one boy, or both of them are girls. And there are 7 equally likely possibilities for any one of the children of taking birth on Tuesday for all these four cases. Therefore, the total cases are 7*4- 1(as there is repetition of two boys two times). The possibility for having two boys with both of them taking birth on Tuesday will be 7*2- 1.
